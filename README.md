# Hacker2108-cracker

Hacker2108 Cracker is a supposed all-in-one Wi-Fi hacking tool that allegedly does the following:


1.Wi-Fi Password Cracking: Claims to crack WEP, WPA, and WPA2 passwords.It probably uses Aircrack-ng under the hood, but who knows.
2. Packet Sniffing: Supposedly sniffs packets to capture usernames, passwords, and other juicy data.Again, likely just a repackaged version of Wireshark or tcpdump.


3.Deauthentication Attack: Can allegedly force clients to reconnect, capturing their handshake for easier password cracking.
